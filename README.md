# Lab: Pose estimation and Augmented Reality
In this lab we will implement pose estimation based on 3D-2D correspondences from scratch!

![Illustration of pose estimation from 3D-2D correspondences](lab-guide/img/pose_estimation.png)

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the lab project.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Camera calibration](lab-guide/2-camera-calibration.md)
3. [Implement homography-based pose estimation](lab-guide/3-implement-homography-based-pose-estimation.md)
4. [Implement Motion-only Bundle Adjustment](lab-guide/4-implement-motion-only-bundle-adjustment.md)

You will find our proposed solution at https://github.com/tek5030/solution-pose-estimation.
Please try to solve the lab with help from others instead of just jumping straight to the solution ;)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
